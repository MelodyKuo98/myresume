      <p>Description</p>
         <a> LAUV is a rising star in the music industry, known for his heartfelt lyrics and catchy beats. As a designer, I had the pleasure of creating a redesign of his album cover and concert poster using postcards as the primary medium. The challenge was to create a design that would convey the modernity of LAUV's music and image, while still being visually captivating and informative.
         <br>
         <br>

To achieve this, I decided to use a photo of the singer to create a 3D template, which I then filled with lyrics from his songs. The use of a 3D template allowed for the design to have depth and dimension, giving it a unique and eye-catching look. Incorporating lyrics into the design added a layer of meaning to the overall aesthetic, giving fans a glimpse into the message behind LAUV's music.

         <br>


The color scheme was another important aspect of the design. Blue and black were chosen as the main colors, as they represent modernity and sophistication. The contrast between the two colors also helped to make the design pop and stand out.

         <br>


When designing album covers and concert posters, it's important to consider the target audience and the overall style of the music. With LAUV's music, the focus is on authenticity, vulnerability, and relatability. The design had to reflect these values while also appealing to the fan base.
<br>
         <br>


In conclusion, the redesign of LAUV's album cover and concert poster using postcards and a 3D template was a creative and successful project. The design conveys the modernity of LAUV's music and image while also incorporating lyrics and meaning into the overall aesthetic. The use of blue and black as the main colors adds sophistication and visual appeal. The design is sure to attract attention and appeal to LAUV's growing fan base.
