            <br>
    The poster includes imagery or symbolism related to the theme of voting and democracy. This might include images of ballot boxes, voting booths, or other symbols of the democratic process. These visuals help to reinforce the message and create a more engaging and memorable design.

    Overall, the design should be simple, clear, and impactful, with a strong emphasis on the message of equal rights and universal suffrage. The use of powerful visuals and typography, combined with a clear call to action, can help to create a poster that is both memorable and effective at driving change.
