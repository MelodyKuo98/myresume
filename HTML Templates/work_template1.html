       <p>Description</p>
       <a>The logo design process is an essential aspect of branding, I've gone through a thorough and creative journey to create a logo that represents my personality and brand.
       <br>
<br>
       
        Starting with the logo sketches, using my initials to come up with potential designs, It allows me to focus on the essential elements of the logo and see what works best for my brand. Vector iterations allow you to create scalable graphics that can be used across different platforms and sizes.
        <br>
       <br>
        
        The final logo in color studies is an essential step in the process, as color plays a vital role in creating a memorable logo. I used color of purple with gradient layers, as it conveys a sense of stability and mystery, I thought it is perfect for a brand related to technology or innovation.
        <br>
       <br>
        
        Finally, the animation of the logo development process is an engaging and entertaining way to showcase the creative journey I went through to arrive at the final design. It's a fun and dynamic way to share my story with others and give them a glimpse into my creative process.
        <br>
       <br>
        
        Overall, the logo reflects my personality and brand. The use of a big "M" with purple color and gradient layers is a clever and effective way to create a memorable and versatile logo that will serve me well in different contexts and sizes.</a>
